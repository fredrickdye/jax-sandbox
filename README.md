Old orphans that have helped some folks over the years.

## Florida Death Penalty

[This is](florida-death-penalty/) an orphan that was intended to be a large package of visualizations exploring the death penalty in Florida either side of the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down the sentencing mechanism in the state. Wasn't picked up and the data was placed here for others to use.

## Jacksonville Crime

### Crime mapping and hotspots
[A map-based visualization](crime-hotspots/) of subsets of crime in Jacksonville from Feb. 2015-Jan. 2016. USed for small "Crime Time" project published in 2016.

### Homicides
[A simple map](homicides-map-2/) and [more developed one](homicides-map-1/) (based on the Hobbit Map) that were the beginning of a 2014 "Decade of Deaths" look at homicides in Jacksonville. These examples use CartoDB datasets.
