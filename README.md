# Jacksonville Sandbox
Some projects once in active development that lacked the necessary support to continue product development, so I moved them here to keep playing with them.

## Florida Death Penalty

[This is](florida-death-penalty/) an orphan that was intended to be a large package of visualizations exploring the death penalty in Florida ahead of, and during the scramble after, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to strike down the sentencing mechanism in the state. It did not garner enough support to allow scheduling adjustment for me to continue work on it, so I moved it here to be slowly advanced and available for others who my wish to utilize the datasets.

## Jacksonville Crime

### Crime mapping and hotspots
[A map-based visualization](crime-hotspots/) looking at select subsets of crime in Jacksonville from Feb. 2015-Jan. 2016. These datasets were the basis for the custom SVG and print "Crime Time" project.

### Homicides
[A simple map](homicides-map-2/) and [more developed one](homicides-map-1/) (based on the Hobbit Map) that was the genesis of my 2014 "Decade of Death" look at homicides in Jacksonville. These examples continue to use the CatoDB datasets.

## Elections

### 2016 Presidential Primaries
[A quick little chart](elections/2016-primary-duval-county-overall/) to gather up the results in Duval County, Florida, as soon as they were released.
